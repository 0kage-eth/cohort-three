**[01/10/2022]**
- Create my Folder structure for EPF cohort 3.
- Research about [Miga Labs](https://migalabs.es/api-documentation), similar to Blockprint, also provides data for the Consensus Client diversity.

**[30/09/2022]**
- Research about the [Project ideas](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-three/blob/master/projects/project-ideas.md) proposed by the program's mentors.
- Brainstorming about [Browser tooling](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-three/blob/master/projects/project-ideas.md#browser-tooling) and with input from [potuz](https://github.com/potuz) & [parithosh](https://github.com/parithosh) decided to dig deeper into **forkchoice** and **Client diversity**.
- Checked out [protovis](https://github.com/tbenr/protovis) work by [tbenr](https://github.com/tbenr), which visualizes the forkchoice. This could possibly be expanded by additionally offering historical data.
- Checked out [Blockprint](https://github.com/sigp/blockprint) work by [Sigma Prime](https://sigmaprime.io/), which gathers data for the Client diversity of the Beacon chain as shown in [sproulM_'s](https://twitter.com/sproulM_/status/1481109509544513539) tweet. There's already [this](https://clientdiversity.org/) site, which shows the client diversity of Ethereum. Partially based on Blockprint data.
- Experimented with [Blockprint's Public API](https://github.com/sigp/blockprint/blob/main/docs/api.md).
- [potuz](https://github.com/potuz) suggested tracking events like block proposals and attestations to catch network splits across clients.
- Set up [my repo](https://github.com/kevinbogner/forkchoice-epf) for EPF with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).
