## How to get mentorship

Mentors from above list are open to help you during the program. They can propose project ideas, answer your questions and guide you if you get stuck at some issue. Keep in mind that each mentor has different capacaity since all of them are working on full time on the protocol. 

Mentors are mainly available in R&D Discord channel and some will attend EPF standup calls. If you didn't get your invite to the server or cannot reach some mentor, reach out to cohort organizers. 

Each mentor is covering certain area of the protocol and representing his development team. If you choose a project they proposed or your project is within their area, ask them if you can set up a project group for easiest communication. Otherwise just ask for the advice in Discord channel. 

Make sure to do your research before you ask a question, e.g. making sure something like this haven't been discussed before in the channel or answered at stackexchange. If the questions targets a specific mentor, feel free to tag him. Your question should be technical and topical, avoid general and unnecceray messages.
